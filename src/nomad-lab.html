                        The NOMAD (Novel Materials Discovery) project began with the NOMAD Repository,
                        founded by Claudia Draxl (HU Berlin) and Matthias Scheffler (FHI Berlin) within
                        a bilateral project funded by the Einstein Foundation Berlin. It was made publicly
                        available in 2014 in cooperation with the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility,
                        which has been running the NOMAD infrastructure since then.

                        Between 2015 and 2018, NOMAD was substantially extended within the
                        HORIZON 2020 European Center of Excellence "The NOMAD Laboratory CoE",
                        with 13 partners, led by Matthias Scheffler. Since then, it supports
                        more than 40 computer codes, and provides services such as the
                        NOMAD Encyclopedia and the NOMAD AI Toolkit.

                        In 2017, the non-profit association FAIR-DI was established as an
                        initiative between Germany and the Netherlands, and quickly became
                        a more international endeavor. The aims were to establish an
                        international research data infrastructure  extending beyond theory,
                        and to seek long-term funding, e.g. to allow NOMAD to become a
                        permanent institution. Matthias Scheffler is the current chairperson
                        of FAIR-DI. Claudia Draxl is a member of the executive board.

                        Since October 2021, the main developments for the NOMAD Lab have
                        been happening in the NOMAD Data Center at HU Berlin (NOMAD HUB).
                        This center was established to host FAIRmat, the NFDI consortium for
                        condensed matter and the chemical physics of solids. FAIRmat is led by
                        Claudia Draxl and co-led by Christoph Koch.
                        Matthias Scheffler was deputy chair until March 2022.

                        The NOMAD Laboratory at the FHI is the research group of
                        Matthias Scheffler, with a strong focus on thermal and electrical
                        transport from first principles and the development and application
                        of artificial intelligence methods. Scheffler and his group also
                        have office space at IRIS Adlershof at HU Berlin, attached to Claudia
                        Draxl's research group. Both groups jointly supervise PhD students
                        and contribute to the developments of the NOMAD Laboratory.

    <div class="section-description">
        After the first phase of the NOMAD CoE (2015-2018), the NOMAD Lab offered four
        individual services. These services are now more and more integrated into
        a coherent software for the public NOMAD service and NOMAD Oasis.
