      Add schemas, ELNs, parsers, and normalizers to an Oasis installation without

  - title: Oasis data transfer

  - title: ELN and upload UI/UX
    description: |
      We added a lot of features (incremental uploads, custom schemas, ELNs, Nexus)
      without re-thinking the UI. We are now working on a better user experience.
